# Driver-Behaviour-Analysis

This repository outlines a methodology that can be used
to study and predict driving pattern and behaviours exhibited
by different drivers, which can be used for fleet monitoring.
The focus lies in analyzing the driving data obtained through
a combination of GPS and accelerometer data by making use
of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Predictions are made
using standard classification models such as Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and K-Nearest Neighbour Classification and their performance accuracy is compared to obtain
the best possible results.
